    <h1 id="about"> ATT&CK Navigator Version {{nav_version}}</h1>
    <p>
        The ATT&CK Navigator is designed to provide basic navigation and
        annotation of ATT&CK matrices, something that people are already doing
        today in tools like Excel. We've designed it to be simple and generic -
        you can use the Navigator to visualize your defensive coverage, your
        red/blue team planning, the frequency of detected techniques or anything
        else you want to do. The Navigator doesn't care - it just allows you to
        manipulate the cells in the matrix (color coding, adding a comment,
        assigning a numerical value, etc.). We thought having a simple tool that
        everyone could use to visualize the matrix would help make it easy to
        use ATT&CK.
    </p>
    <p>
        The principal feature of the Navigator is the ability for users to
        define layers - custom views of the ATT&CK knowledge base - e.g. showing
        just those techniques for a particular platform or highlighting
        techniques a specific adversary has been known to use. Layers can be
        created interactively within the Navigator or generated programmatically
        and then visualized via the Navigator.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bug reports and feature requests can be submitted to our <a href="https://github.com/mitre/attack-navigator/issues">GitHub Issue Tracker</a>.
        The source code for the ATT&CK Navigator can be retrieved from our

    <h1 id="help_Layers">Layers</h1>
    <p>
      A layer constitutes a view of the tactics and techniques matrix for a
      specific technology domain. Version 1 of the Navigator can manipulate
      either the Enterprise (Windows, Linux & Mac) or Mobile (Android & iOS)
      ATT&CK technology domain knowledge bases. Within a technology domain, the
      Navigator allows you to filter your view of the matrix in a variety of
      ways, displaying the tactics and techniques that are important to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can view the definition of any technique in the visible matrix by
      right-clicking on the technique and selecting "view technique" in the
      pop-up menu. A new browser tab will be opened displaying the definition of
      the technique. In this way the Navigator allows you to explore a given
      ATT&CK matrix and access the definitions of the techniques.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond the filters, layers also provide a means to customize your view of
      the matrix. To that end you can <a href="#help_Assigning_Manual_Colors">color</a>, <a href="#help_Hiding_Disabled_Techniques">hide</a>, <a href="#help_Adding_Comments_to_Techniques">comment</a>, and assign <a href="#help_Scoring_Techniques">numeric
      scores</a> to techniques to aid in analysis of threats and your defenses
      against those threats. As stated earlier, the Navigator is designed to be
      simple, allowing you to assign whatever meaning you want to the
      color-codings, scores, and comments. This way the Navigator can support
      whatever you want to do without requiring changes to the Navigator code
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each layer created is independent of other layers. However, layers can be
      <a href="#help_Creating_Layers_from_Other_Layers">combined</a> in ways to support analysis, or <a href="#help_Saving_and_Loading_Layers">saved locally</a>. Layer files are
      saved in easy to parse and easy to generate JSON file so that ATT&CK data
      can be used in other applications, analyzed beyond the capability of the
      ATT&CK Navigator, and generated by tools for import into the Navigator.
      The Layer file format is described <a href="assets/NavigatorLayerFileFormatv1_1.pdf">here</a>.
    </p>


    <h2 id="help_Creating_New_Layers">Creating New Layers</h2>
    <p>
        To create a new layer, open a new tab and click the "Create New Layer" button.
        Note that for performance reasons, the Navigator currently imposes a limit of
        ten (10) active layers at any given point in time.
    </p>
    <h2 id="help_Saving_and_Loading_Layers">Saving and Loading Layers</h2>
    <p>
        Layers can be saved by clicking the "save layer" button (<img src="assets/ic_file_download_black_24px.svg">). This will open a dialog
        to save a layer configuration file to your local computer. This contains
        the configuration for the techniques that have been customized
        (commented, colored, assigned a score, or disabled) as well as the
        scoring gradient setup, filter selection, layer name, layer description,
        view configuration.
    </p>
    <p>
        Saved layer configuration files can be opened in the ATT&CK navigator to
        restore a layer you've worked on previously. To do so, open a new tab
        and open the "Open Existing Layer" panel. Then click "Upload from
        local", and select your saved configuration file. Doing so will restore
        your saved layer to the ATT&CK navigator. This interface also has a "load from URL"
        input allowing you to open a layer json from a remote source.
    </p>
    <h2 id="help_Creating_Layers_from_Other_Layers">Creating Layers from Other Layers</h2>
    <p>
        Layers can be created which inherit properties from other layers. Several fields
        exist which can be used to choose which layers to inherit properties from:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Score Expression:</b> Technique <a href="#help_Scoring_Techniques">scores</a>  in the created layer are
                initialized to the result of this expression. This field should take
                the form of an equation or constant, using variables for layers.
                Layer variables are shown in yellow on tabs when the "create layer
                from other layers" panel is opened:
            </p>
            <img src="assets/image_scoreVariableExample.png" height="100px">
            <p>
                Each technique's score is created independently using the score expression. For example,
                with a score expression of <code>a+b</code>, some technique <i>t</i> in the output layer would
                be the sum of <i>t<sub>a</sub></i> and <i>t<sub>b</sub></i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Expressions can also be comparative, for example <code>a>b</code>
                will create a layer with a score of 1 whereever <code>a>b</code> and
                0 whereever <code>a<=b</code>. Such boolean expressions can be
                extended using <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, <code>xor</code>
                and <code>not</code>. See <a href="http://mathjs.org/docs/expressions/syntax.html#operators">
                    this page</a> for a  full list of operators.
                </p>
                Some example score expressions:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>(a+b)/2</code> (average two layers)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>a+b+c</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>a*(b+c)</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>100-a</code> (reverse the scoring of <code>a</code>, assuming <code>a</code> is on a 0-100 scale)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>(a>b) and (a>=75)</code>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Coloring:</b> choose which layer to inherit <a href="#help_Assigning_Manual_Colors">manually assigned technique colors</a> from.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Comments:</b> choose which layer to inherit <a href="#help_Adding_Comments_to_Techniques">technique comments</a> from.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>States:</b> choose which layer to inherit technique <a href="#help_Disabling_Techniques">enabled/disabled states</a> from.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Filters:</b> choose which layer to inherit <a href="#help_Filtering">layer filter configuration</a> from.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Tip:</b> Score expressions don't need to use variables! You can use
            this to create a new layer with a constant score for each technique. For
            example, if you wanted a new layer where all techniques are scored 50, you
            could simply type 50 into the score expression input.

        <h2 id="help_Filtering">
            <img src="assets/ic_filter_list_black_24px.svg"/>
            Filtering
        </h2>
        <p>
            The list of techniques and tactics can be filtered in the filtering menu.
            Filters are additive - the displayed set of techniques is the logical <i>or</i>
            of the techniques of the filters selected. There are two categories of filters that you can apply to a layer - a platform filter and a stages filter.
        </p>
        <h3>Platform Filter</h3>
        <p>
            The platform filter allows the user to control which techniques are
            included in a layer based on whether or not a particular technique
            applies to a particular technology platform.  Technology platforms
            are tied to the specific technology domain you are visualizing. For
            the Enterprise technology domain, the defined platforms are:
            Windows, Linux and Mac.  For the Mobile technology domain, the
            defined platforms are: Android and iOS.  By default, all platforms
            for a given technology domain are selected in a newly-created layer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each technique in an ATT&CK matrix is tied to one or more platforms.
            In the Navigator, if you wanted to see only those techniques in
            Enterprise ATT&CK which applied to the Linux platform, you would
            deselect "Windows" and "Mac" under the platform filter. If later you
            decided to also include techniques known to apply to MacOS
            platforms, you could select "Mac" as well and those techniques would
            be added to the visible layer.
        </p>
        <h3>Stage Filter</h3>
        <p>
            In addition to filtering based on technology platform, you can also
            control which techniques to include in a layer based on where they
            fall in the cyber attack lifecycle.  The Navigator defines two
            "stages" in this lifecycle: "prepare" - those tactics that an
            adversary uses prior to compromise of their target and "act" - those
            tactic categories at and after the launch of a compromise attempt.
            By default, only the "act" stage is selected in a newly-created
            layer to help keep the visible matrix to a manageable size. Note
            that when viewing a layer with both the prepare and act stages
            selected, you may find the "compact" matrix view particularly
            useful.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Tip:</b> Techniques can also be hidden from your view by using the <a href="#help_Hiding_Disabled_Techniques">hide disabled techniques</a>
            button. Couple this with the <a href="#help_Multiselct_Interface">multiselect interface</a>
            to hide techniques which are contained in specific threat or software groupings.
        </p>

        <h2 id="help_Scoring">
            <img src="assets/ic_palette_black_24px.svg"/>
            Scoring Gradient Setup
        </h2>
        <p>
            Techniques which are assigned a score will be colored according to a
            gradient defined in the scoring gradient setup menu. Technique scores are
            mapped to a color scaled linearly between the "low value" and "high value"
            inputs. For example, on a red-green scale, if "low value" were set to 0 and
            "high value" were set to 50, a score of 25 would fall on yellow -- exactly
            halfway between red and green. Scores below the low value are colored as if
            they have the low value, and scores above the high value are colored as if
            they have the high value.
        </p>
        <p>
            Several preset gradients are present within the preset menu. If no preset
            matches your desired gradient, you can create your own by adding and removing
            colors using the interface.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Tip:</b> If your scores are binary (0 or 1), consider setting the low
            value of 0 to white and the high of 1 to some other
            color to only color the techniques which have the value of 1.
        </p>

            Hidden techniques are still present in the data when saved and can still be annotated, but won't be visible in the view.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Tip:</b> This button has powerful synergy with the <a

            Scoring Techniques
        </h2>
        <p>
            A score is a numeric value assigned to a technique. The meaning or
            interpretation of scores is completely up to the user user - the
            Navigator simply visualizes the matrix based on any scores you have
            assigned. Some possible uses of scores include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Assigning a score to techniques based on whether or not a given
                adversary group has been observed to use that technique.
            </li>
            <li>
                Assigning a score to techniques based on your organization's
                ability to detect, prevent and/or mitigate the use of a
                particular technique.
            </li>
             <li>
                 Assigning a score to those techniques that a red-team has
                 successfully employed during an exercise.
             </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            By default, techniques are "unscored" meaning that no score has been
            assigned to the technique.  Note that "unscored" and a score of zero
            are not the same, specifically with respect to automatically
            assigned colors. Scores show up in technique tooltips if a score has
            been assigned. To change a technique with a numeric score to
            unscored, select the technique and delete the score value in the score
            control. The technique will revert to unscored.
        </p>
        <p>
            Techniques are automatically assigned a color according to its
            score. This color is determined according to the <a href="#help_Scoring">scoring gradient setup interface</a>. Colors
            assigned <a href="#help_Assigning_Manual_Colors">manually</a>
            supersede the score-generated color. It is a good idea to assign
            techniques scores inside of a given range, such as 0-1 or 0-100. Set
            the "high value" and "low value" inputs in the <a href="#help_Scoring">scoring gradient setup interface</a> to this
            range to make sure that the color for the score is properly mapped
            to the gradient. Techniques that are unscored are not assigned a
            color based on the gradient - they are displayed with a white
            background in the matrix.

        <p>
            A text comment can be added to techniques. This comment will show up in the technique tooltip if a comment has been added.
            Techniques with a comment will be given a yellow underline.

        <h1 id="help_Selecting_Techniques">Selecting Techniques</h1>

        <p>
            In order to be annotated, techniques must first be selected. There are multiple ways
            to select techniques.
        </p>
        <h2 id="help_Selecting_with_the_Mouse">Selecting with the Mouse</h2>
        <p>
            Techniques can be selected using the mouse. Left click a technique to select
            it. Pressing control (windows) command (mac) or shift (both) while left-clicking a technique will add it to or remove it from the selection. Right
            clicking a technique will bring up a context menu with more options:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>select:</b> Select only this technique.</li>
            <li><b>add to selection:</b> Add this technique to the selection.</li>
            <li><b>remove from selection:</b> remove this technique from the selection.</li>
            <li><b>invert selection:</b> Select all techniques that are not currently selected and unselect all techniques that are currently selected.</li>
            <li><b>select all:</b> Select all techniques.</li>
            <li><b>deselect all:</b> Deselect all techniques. This action can also be completed by the "deselect" (<img src="assets/ic_close_black_24px.svg"/>) button.</li>
            <li><b>view technique:</b> For more information / details on the technique.</li>

        <p>
            The search interface provides a text input to search through techniques in the matrix.
            Toggles in the interface allow for searching of specific technique fields (name, ID, and description).
        </p>
        <p>
            The interface provides
            buttons to select and deselect techniques. These buttons modify the currently selected techniques rather
            than replacing then, allowing for the selection of the multiple techniques by selecting them in sequence.
            There are 'view' links that lead to more info on each technique.
        </p>
        <p>
            Buttons labelled 'select all' and 'deselect all' are provided to quickly select/deselect all techniques in the results
            area.

            Multiselect Interface
        </h2>
        <p>
            The multiselect interface provides a way to quickly select and deselect
            groups of techniques. The interface provides two types of groupings, threat
            groups and software. Threat groups constitute related intrusion activity
            tracked by a common name. Software constitutes software, malware
            or utilities that use known techniques for intrusion.
        </p>
        <p>
            The interface provides
            buttons to select and deselect techniques associated with each software or
            threat group. These buttons modify the currently selected techniques rather
            than replacing then, allowing for the selection of the techniques of multiple
            threat groups or software by selecting them in sequence.
        </p>
        <p>
            Threat groups and software in the list are given a gray background when all
            of their techniques are selected, even if the selection was not made using
            the multiselect interface.
